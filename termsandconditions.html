      YOUR INDEMNITY TO RS. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you will indemnify, defend and hold RS, including RS’s partners, officers, directors, agents, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, parents, successors and assigns, harmless from any claim, demand, cause of action, debt or liability (including reasonable attorney's fees, expenses and court costs) arising from: (a) your modification(s) of and/or addition(s) to Product(s); (b) your breach of this Agreement, (c) your omissions, misrepresentations, or negligence, and (d) damage to a third party as a result of Products sold by you to the extent such claim is based on (i) your modification of and/or addition to the Products, misuse or abuse of the Products, negligence or breach of any provision in this Agreement; (ii) your failure to abide by all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders that affect the Products; (iii) your omission, misrepresentation, or negligence, or (iv) intentional harm to any person or property caused by you or the end-user. Indemnified claims, debts and liabilities include the amount of any discount in price or concession that is made available by RS to you.
      Dispute Resolution. The parties will attempt to resolve any claim, or dispute or controversy (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) against RS, its agents, employees, successors, assigns or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this paragraph, "RS”) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, RS’s advertising, or any related purchase (a "Dispute”) through face to face negotiation with persons fully authorized to resolve the Dispute or through mediation utilizing a mutually agreeable mediator, rather than through litigation. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation or mediation within a reasonable time after written notice from one party to the other that a Dispute exists, the Dispute will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration. The Arbitration will be conducted before three (3) independent and impartial arbitrators. RS will appoint one (1) arbitrator and the other party or parties will appoint one (1) arbitrator. The two (2) appointed arbitrators will then select a third arbitrator, who shall be the presiding arbitrator. The arbitration hearing shall take place in Atlanta, Georgia and will be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act to the exclusion of any inconsistent state laws. The arbitrators shall base their award on the terms of this Agreement, and will follow the law and judicial precedents that a United States District Judge would apply to the Dispute. The arbitrators shall render their award in writing and will include the findings of fact and conclusion of law upon which their award is based. Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The existence or results of any negotiation, mediation or arbitration will be treated as confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party will have the right to obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other equitable relief to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm, although the merits of the underlying Dispute will be resolved in accordance with this paragraph.<br><br>
      Independent Contractors. No provision of this Agreement will or shall be deemed to create a partnership, joint venture or other combination between RS and you. You and RS are independent contractors. Neither party will make any warranties or representations or assume any obligations on the other party’s behalf. Neither party is nor will claim to be a legal representative, partner, franchisee, agent or employee of the other party. Each party is responsible for the amounts it incurs arising from this Agreement and for the direction and compensation, and is liable for the actions of, its employees and subcontractors.<br><br>
      Governing Law. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT, ANY SALES THERE UNDER, OR ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PREEXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, COMMON LAW, AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND RS arising from or relating to this agreement, its interpretation, or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from this agreement, RS’s advertising, or any related purchase SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS RULES.
      Binding Arbitration. ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PREEXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND RS, its agents, employees, principals, successors, assigns, affiliates (collectively for purposes of this paragraph, "RS”) arising from or relating to this Agreement, its interpretation, or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from this Agreement (including, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, relationships with third parties who are not signatories to this Agreement), RS’s advertising, or any related purchase SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE NATIONAL ARBITRATION FORUM (NAF) under its Code of Procedure then in effect (available via the Internet at http://www.arb-forum.com, or via telephone at 1-800-474-2371). In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between NAF Code of Procedure and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be limited solely to the dispute or controversy between customer and RS. NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR RS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS, OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS ACTION OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The individual (non-class) nature of this dispute provision goes to the essence of the parties’ arbitration agreement, and if found unenforceable, the entire arbitration provision shall not be enforced. This transaction involves interstate commerce, and this provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). Any award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. RS will be responsible for paying any arbitration fees to the extent such fees exceed the amount of the filing fee for initiating a claim in the small claims or similar court in the state in which you reside. Each party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys’ fees, if any. However, if any customer prevails on any claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys’ fees, or if there is a written agreement providing for fees, the Arbitrator may award reasonable fees to the prevailing party, under the standards for fee shifting provided by law. Information may be obtained and claims may be filed with the NAF at P.O. Box 50191, Minneapolis, MN 55405.<br><br>
      Export. You acknowledge that the purchased goods licensed or sold under this Agreement, and the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, which may include technology and software, are subject to the customs and export control laws and regulations of the United States ("U.S.”) and may also be subject to the customs and export laws and regulations of the country in which the products are manufactured and/or received. You acknowledge that it is your sole responsibility to comply with and abide by those laws and regulations. Further, under U.S. law, the goods shipped pursuant to this Agreement may not be sold, leased or otherwise transferred to restricted countries or utilized by restricted end-users or an end-user engaged in activities related to weapons of mass destruction, including without limitation, activities related to the design, development, production or use of nuclear weapons, materials, or facilities, missiles or the support of missile projects, and chemical or biological weapons. You agree not to provide any written regulatory certifications or notifications on behalf of RS.
      Headings. The section headings used herein are for convenience of reference only and do not form a part of these terms and conditions, and no construction or inference shall be derived there from. If any provision of this Agreement is void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and will not be terminated. Neither party will be liable for any delays resulting from circumstances or causes beyond the party’s reasonable control.
